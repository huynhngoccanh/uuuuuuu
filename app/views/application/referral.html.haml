        #referral-bottom-h1 How the Ubitru Referral Platform Works:
        #referral-bottom-h2 When you refer a friend...
        #referral-bottom-text1
          That's not a current Ubitru user to register on the platform you get paid. You will get paid (cash) every time your referral calls a merchant, purchases a product,
          uses a coupon or requests a quote. You will receive 10% back on everything your referral does online for up to 1 year.
        #referral-bottom-h3 Don't worry
        #referral-bottom-text2 Your friends will still receive 70% for everything they do.
